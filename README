***Jarnaby E-Reader***

The goal of the Jarnaby project is to create a simple-to-use platform for the creation and distribution of hypertext stories for handheld devices. Hypertext fiction is a form of electronic storytelling. In contrast to traditional narratives, in which there is a prescribed linear sequence to the text, hypertext fiction lets the reader follow hyperlinks within the text. Thus, there are many ways to read the story, and each re-reading may present a different way of looking at the story.

The Jarnaby Project is a research effort funded by Brigham Young University Hawaii.
